# WeatherApp
This app shows weather condition with some cute response. You just need to activate GPS and/or WiFi, because of this app using your current location.

## Used APIs
This app take weather condition from [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev/)'s API.

## Resources
This app contains some photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). That's really cool site.

### TODOs
You should create Constants class like below code, that can be reachable from MainActivity.
```Java
public class Constants {
    public static final String SECRET_KEY = "SECRET_KEY_FROM_DARKSKY_ACCOUNT";
}
```

#### Platforms
I hope, I'll take some times to create iOS app -with Swift- like this one.
